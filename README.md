# Encryption_and_Decryption_Data
A web base application to Encryption and Decryption Data. Used technologies are PHP, HTML, CSS, hashing algorithm, encrypt algorithm & decrypt algorithm.
First download and extract the ZIP file. Then you will get the relevant database and the application. Open your SQL server (eg:- WAMP SERVER) and create a new database called “users”, then import the database that I provided, database name is “users”. Then copy and paste the application folder (EncryptionDB) in your server folder (pathway as eg: C:\wamp\www). Now open your localhost and type : localhost/EncryptionDB/index.php . This will load your home page. All the files inside the EncryptionDB file should be in the same folder. I already uploaded 2 images to show how it is. Now you can enter any data and check the output. Also check how that entered data is storing in your databse. Password is Hashed, so it is not going to decrypt.
